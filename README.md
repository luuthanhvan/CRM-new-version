# CRM

<b>Customer Relationship Management</b> application - a web-based that enables businesses to manage customer data, track sales and activities. 

## 📖 Introduction

This is a new version of a CRM application that I built during my internship at a tech company.

<b>🚀 What's new?</b>

- A brand new user interface - colors, fonts, styles
- Restructuring the application folder structure as well as the codebase
- Introducing some new features (<i>in progress</i>)

## 🧬 Repo structure

This repo is separated into two main folders ```ui``` and ```server```. <br />
```ui``` contains the UI code <br />
```server``` contains the BE code <br />

So first of all you need to install the necessary libraries and run the code separately in these two directories. I have attached README.md file which contains detailed installation instruction in each folder. So let's find out! 😉

## 📝 Prerequisites

- Operating System - Windows 10 or 11
- Node.js - ^20.11.1, or ^22.0.0.
- Angular - v19.2.0 or latest
- Text editor - Visual Studio Code
- Terminal - Required for running the app. I recommend you use `Windows Terminal` which can be found and installed via Microsoft Store if you are using Windows OS. You can open multiple ternimal tabs under one window, Unicode and UTF-8 character support, custom themes, styles, and configurations.

<b>Note</b>: There is the fact that Javascript code can only be executed inside the browser. If you want to run the standalone Javascript code, you do need a tool to run and compile them on your local machine. That is the reason why we need NodeJS, a JavaScript runtime environment. So first up, make sure you have already installed NodeJS before install other requirements. In case, you have not, please follow the instruction in `server/README.md` to install it!
