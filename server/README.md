## 👨‍🔧 Installation

### 🧟‍♀️ NodeJS

1. Install NVM which allows you to manage and install multiple node versions on your computer. You can easily switch between node versions for each specific project you are working on. You can find the download page here https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases. At the latest section, click on `nvm-setup.exe` to download and then install it. You can download the latest version of `nvm` if the version you found on the page is higher than the version you see this guideline.
